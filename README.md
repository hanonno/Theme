=====

Theme utility class for iOS. 

1. Modify the photoshop template

It's already sliced to generate the correct images

2. Export the sliced images
---------------------------

- Make sure slices is set to 'all user slices'.
- The images should be saved somewhere in your project

The included code looks in the default bundle [UIImage imageNamed:]
